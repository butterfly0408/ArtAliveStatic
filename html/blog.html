                                <p>Gini Harris was born in 1964 in Benoni on the East Rand, Gauteng. She matriculated in 1982 and thereafter studied Graphic Design at the Witwatersrand Technikon. She worked as a technical illustrator and at the same time also developed her fine art career completing many successful commissions.</p>
                                <p>In 2008 Gini discovered miniature art and was instantly hooked. Since then she has had a great deal of success winning many awards and participating in numerous exhibitions both internationally and locally. Most recently in 2021 she received the highly prestigious MAA Award making her a member of the Miniature Artists of America. </p>
                                <p>She is well known for her commissioned landscapes and portraits. Her favourite subject to paint is people, especially in larger artworks, but also love painting landscapes, plants and trees, still lives and most recently, botanical art in miniature.</p>
                                <p>Although happy to work to any size and proficient in many styles and mediums, she has had a great deal of success with miniature art in oils. Apart from commissioned artworks, she works mostly from her own photographs, obsessively collecting reference material and often keeping photos for years before painting them. </p>

                        <h3>Happy New Year <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-up"></i></h3>
                        <p>As we say goodbye to another incredible year at Art Alive Art School, we reflect on the canvases we've filled, the skills we've learned, and the creativity that has flourished. </p>
                        <p>I am reading a book by Emily P. Freeman, where she talks about uncovering the Art we were made to live and that we should move towards that which makes us feel alive.  For me spending time with loved ones and creating my Art always makes me feel alive.  </p>
                        <p>In her book, A million little ways, Emily quotes this from John Acuff: “More often than not, finding out what you love doing most is about recovering an old love or an inescapable truth that has been silenced for years, even decades. When you come to your dream job, your thing, it is rarely a first encounter. It's usually a reunion. So instead of setting out to discover this thing you love doing, you've got to change your thinking and set out to recover it, maybe even rescue it!” </p>
                        <p>This quote made me think that all of our students should be proud of the reunion that they have made with their art.  May we all continue to explore our creativity. </p>
                        <p>I wish all our talented artists a New Year filled with boundless inspiration, vibrant palettes, and the joy of endless artistic possibilities. </p>
                        <p>May your brushes dance across the canvas of 2024!</p>
                        <p>Happy New Year from myself and our wonderful teachers. We look forward to welcoming you back at the School.</p>
